# Simple Image Editor: MVP Implementation Plan

## 1\. Core Goal

The primary goal is to create an incredibly easy-to-use tool based on the "less is more" philosophy. The user should be able to perform basic image edits without needing any prior experience or complex tutorials. The entire application will run on the client-side using a browser-first computation model.

## 2\. MVP Feature Set

The MVP will include the following core features:

  - [ ] **Image Upload:** Load an image from a user's local device.
  - [ ] **Cropping:** An intuitive, visual cropping tool.
  - [ ] **One-Click Filters:** Apply simple filters like Grayscale, Sepia, and Invert.
  - [ ] **Basic Adjustments:** Sliders to control Brightness and Contrast.
  - [ ] **Download:** Save the final edited image back to the user's device.
